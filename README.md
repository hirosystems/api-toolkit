The API Toolkit Library is a comprehensive collection of tools designed by Hiro to simplify common
tasks in API development. This library provides functionalities for database management, application
shutdown handlers, migration helpers, server version management, etc. It aims to streamline the
development process and improve code quality by offering convenient and reusable modules.

## Installation

You can start by installing the API Toolkit Library using npm:
